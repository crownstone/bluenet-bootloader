Version 1.3.0:
 - Changed release path.
 - Config uart after initializing gpio (igbt and relay pins).
 - Add BOOTLOADER_COMPILATION flag so we can exclude headers from cs_Nordic.h (such as the ones for ADC).
 - Reduced size of some logs.
 - Optimize compiler by using -flto (optimizes globally rather than only for individual compilation units).

Version 1.2.2:
 - Don't write bootloader version as firmware version for release.
 - Fixed bug in release script.
 - Updated release script. Now overwrites some config values.

Version 1.2.2:
 - Fixed logging functions.
 - Fixed missing DFU_APP_DATA_RESERVED, which would brick the crownstone.
 - Merge branch 'master' of github.com:dobots/nrf51-dfu-bootloader-for-gcc-compiler
 - Fixes for new build scripts. Check me please.

 - added success to create_release
 - added create_release script updated all.sh and Makefile for release build
 - bugfix bootloader
 - Version bump to 1.2.0
 - made bootloader independent of hardware board / device type. reads out board and type from UICR
 - updated dfu_bl_image_validate to avoid bricking bootloader when updating from 1.0.0 becasue APP_DATA_RESERVED value changed
 - Version bump to 1.1.0
 - Merge branch 'master' of github.com:crownstone/bluenet-bootloader
 - fixe for app reserved data (use value directly from BLUENET pstorage_platform.h) optional, let APP_DATA_RESERVED overwrite value (but allow only increased value)
 - silly commit!
 - Version bump to 1.0.0
 - updated hardware version updated device type check
 - updated README
 - moved device info service to separate dev_info_service.c use hardware version from bluenet fixed multi target build/clean
 - added device information service to bootloader with hardware version and firmware version
 - fixed path in scripts to call outside scripts folder
 - replace echo by printf
 - improved scripts, added colors, added error reporting
 - moved check_targets out of config.sh again (buggy)
 - use config script from BLUENET_DIR scripts folder copy binaries to BLUENET_BIN_DIR instead of build dir
 - Use BLUENET_BUILD_DIR to copy binaries to
 - works?
 - Compiles for nrf52, sdk11, s132
 - Merge branch 'master' of github.com:dobots/nrf51-dfu-bootloader-for-gcc-compiler
 - Make sure the switch gpio is in the correct state on boot
 - updated README
 - include CMakeBuild.config.local if present
 - use softdevice of nordic sdk if not specified otherwise
 - update bootloader to handle brownouts
 - detect accidental resets and go into dfu mode after a number of resets
 - bugfix VERBOSE if SERIAL_VERBOSITY=NONE
 - Removed bug fixes from README (don't have any of the fixes and it worked for s130 v1.0, so I assume they are obsolete)
 - moved include, gcc and arm folders out of source folder to root folder
 - Merge branch 'sdk_8' of github.com:dobots/nrf51-dfu-bootloader-for-gcc-compiler into sdk_8
 - clear reset register by default after entering bootloader
 - adjusted log messages
 - adjusted log messages
 - merged with bootloader from nrf sdk 11
 - cleanup
 - reorganized. removed everything unneccessary
 - also output a .hex file for dfu
 - increase timeout to 4 minutes, so that we can definitely send 120kB
 - Enable app size of larger than 64k
 - removed old code
 - Include the .default and .local config files
 - Merge branch 'sdk_8' of github.com:dobots/nrf51-dfu-bootloader-for-gcc-compiler into sdk_8
 - removed leds
 - Update README.md
 - ignore generated file
 - Use config file settings
 - Now works for S110
 - copied files from sdk 8.1 and used sdk 8.1 example
 - compiles for sdk 8.1, s130 1.0.0
 - update to targets script
 - added check_targets (to compile bootloader for different targets)
 - removed boards_h replaced LED_x by PIN_GPIO_LEDx
 - Merge with adaptations from Bart
 - 1.) Remove dobots_boards.h. 2.) Adapt Makefile so cs_Boards.h from BLUENET directory will be used. 3.) Update references. 4.) Rename all BOARD macros to HARDWARE_BOARD
 - BLUENET_DIR is now BLUENET_CONFIG_DIR, added new boards
 - 1. Add goto script. 2. Use board parameter in CMakeBuild.config and emit error if not defined
 - Add copyright
 - Update README with difference between S110 and S130
 - Merge branch 'master' into s110
 - Working for S110 as well as S130
 - Remove all references to LEDs. If pins are high when the 220V is applied. This won't be fun
 - Use bluenet config options
 - Use synthesized clock for the Crownstone
 - Add BOARD=X option
 - Typo size instead of objsize
 - On startup application was not recognized. Now it is.
 - Add printing info.
 - Add functionality at main that reads the register set by the normal binary
 - Make error actually cause a BPKT
 - Set bootloader to 0x34000 address.
 - Add script to build
 - Add macro to change bootloader start address. But don't do it yet.
 - #define DISABLE_TURN_OFF_FOR_S130
